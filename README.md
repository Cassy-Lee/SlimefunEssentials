# SlimefunToEmi
Slimefun to EMI is a minecraft mod that adds items from the Slimefun4 plugin and addons to EMI the recipe viewer mod! As time passes I will add support for more and more slimefun 4 addons as well as various abstract recipes from slimefun and its addons!

Configuration (requires mod menu & cloth config):

Toggle for Manual or Machine default Recipes (for the recipe trees. See What does it do)
Toggle for all Slimefun Addon Support
# What does it do:
- Includes all Core Slimefun Items
- Includes all Core Slimefun Item Recipes
- Includes all Core Slimefun Machine Recipes
- Includes all Core Slimefun Generator Recipes
- Fill Multiblock Recipes into the Dispensers of Multiblocks with a click of a Button!
- Supports Core Recipe Trees
- Includes Various Addon Items & Recipes (See Addon List)
# How does it do it:
Each recipe tells you all that you need to know, if it is a multiblock it gives you a dispenser 3 by 3 crafting grid like you would when using the multiblock
If it is an electric machine recipe, it tells you if its generating or using electriciy and how much. As well as how long the recipe will take to process.
And More
